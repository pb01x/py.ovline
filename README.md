# py.ovline: Python MVC Framework

**py.ovline** is a Python Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework designed for efficient and rapid web application development. It provides a set of tools and conventions to help you structure your web projects in a clean, organized, and maintainable way.

* **Rapid Development:** Streamlines common web development tasks, allowing you to build applications faster.
* **Clean Structure:** Promotes a well-organized project structure, making your code easier to understand and maintain.
* **URL Routing:** Provides a flexible and intuitive system for mapping URLs to controller actions.
* **Template Engine:** Integrates with a templating engine (e.g., Jinja2 - *You'll need to specify which one(s) your framework uses*) to create dynamic and reusable views.
* **Database Support:** Offers tools for interacting with databases (e.g., ORM - *You'll need to specify which one(s) or library.  If you have your own ORM, describe it*).
* **Easy to Learn:** Designed to be approachable for both beginners and experienced Python developers.
* **Extensible:** Allows you to easily extend the framework's functionality with custom components and libraries.
* **MIT Licensed:** Open-source and permissive, allowing for use in both personal and commercial projects.
